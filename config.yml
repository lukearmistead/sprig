  TRANSACTIONS TO CATEGORIZE:
  {transactions}

  TRANSACTION FIELDS:
  - description: The transaction description from your bank
  - counterparty: The merchant or entity name (when available)
  - amount: Transaction amount (negative values are refunds or credits)
  - account_name & account_subtype: The account this transaction occurred in (e.g., "credit_card", "checking", "savings")

  CATEGORIZATION PROCESS:
  1. Read each transaction's description, counterparty (if available), amount, and account type carefully
  2. USE ACCOUNT TYPE AS CONTEXT:
     - Credit card transactions are NEVER income (even if negative/refunds)
     - Checking/savings negative amounts may be income (salary, deposits) or refunds
     - Credit card payments from checking → categorize as "loan" or "general" not "income"
  3. Look for KEY WORDS that strongly indicate a category:
     - "INSURANCE" + auto/car context → likely vehicle-related
     - "AUTOPAY", "PYMT", "PAYMENT" → likely a transfer or bill payment
     - Gas station names (Shell, Chevron, Pilot, Fast Stop, BP, etc.) → check amount to determine fuel vs. snacks
  4. Use transaction amounts as strong hints:
     - Gas stations: $30+ usually fuel, under $15 usually snacks/drinks
     - Pharmacies: $100+ usually prescriptions, under $20 usually personal items
  5. HANDLING NEGATIVE AMOUNTS (refunds/credits):
     - Negative amounts are often refunds, NOT income or transfers
     - Categorize refunds based on the merchant/counterparty, not the negative amount
     - Example: A -$50 from REI is a refund for outdoor/sporting goods, not income
     - Example: A -$25 from a restaurant is a dining refund, not a transfer
     - Example: A -$100 on a credit card from Amazon is a return, not income
     - Only categorize as income when clearly salary, deposits, transfers between YOUR accounts
  6. Match to the MOST SPECIFIC applicable category based on all available information
  7. Avoid over-using "general" - it should be rare. Most transactions have a logical category
  8. Only use "undefined" when the merchant and purpose are genuinely unclear
  9. CONFIDENCE SCORING (0 to 1):
     - Assign a confidence score to each categorization based on how certain you are
     - High confidence (0.8-1.0): Clear merchant name, obvious category (e.g., "Starbucks" → dining)
     - Medium confidence (0.5-0.79): Some ambiguity but likely correct (e.g., gas station with small amount could be snacks or fuel)
     - Low confidence (0-0.49): Unclear merchant, vague description, or multiple possible categories

  CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
  - You MUST use ONLY the exact category names listed above
  - DO NOT create new categories like "personal_care", "education", or "subscriptions"
  - If tempted to use a category not in the list, use "general" instead
  - Every category in your response MUST match one from AVAILABLE CATEGORIES exactly
  - Categorize EVERY transaction (no skipping)

  VALIDATION:
  Before returning your response, verify that EVERY category you used appears in the AVAILABLE CATEGORIES list above. If not, your response is invalid.
